        <h3>Project – Data Science Specialization</h3>
        <p><a
        href="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=listingPage"
        target="_blank">Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of Public Health.</a> The
        data science specialization, a series of nine online courses offered by the Bloomberg
        School of Public Health’s Department of Biostatistics, covers the whole data science
        process – a field dedicated to identifying, collecting, refining, analyzing and
        interpreting data in a wide range of areas, from finance to public health. Details on
        the courses and enrollment opportunities are available at the above link. Below is a
        select series of R programming assignments for various courses in the series.</p>
        <h4>Reproducible Research: Data Science Specialization &mdash; Course 5 of 9</h4>
        <p>This course focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses
        in a reproducible manner. Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more
        generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that
        others may verify the findings and build upon them.  The need for reproducibility is
        increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets
        and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows users to focus on the actual
        content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written
        summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because
        the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This course
        focuses on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses
        in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain
        the same results.</p>

                    StormDataEventTable</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; This downloadable file (StormDataEventTable.csv)
                    is a concordance table between the widely variable storm event descriptors
                    used through the reporting period 1950 &mdash; 2015 and the <em>standardized</em>
                    storm event descriptors set out in NOAA Directive 10-1605, Storm Data Preparation,
                    which states: "The only events permitted in Storm Data are listed in this table.
                    The chosen event name should be one that describes the meterological event
                    leading to fatalities, injuries, damage, etc." This concordance table is
                    accompanied by R code that can be used to condition the Storm Data and
                    update all descriptors to conform to the current standards, as well as
                    documentation on the NOAA <em>National Centers for Environmental Information</em>
                    and the data sets being analyzed.</p>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
